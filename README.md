## ❤️ Valentine Yes/No Interactive Page

A playful, fully responsive Valentine’s Day interactive web page built with **pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no dependencies.

This project recreates a classic **Yes / No** interaction where:

- The **“No” button actively avoids the cursor or touch**, making it impossible to click.
- The **“Yes” button slowly grows over time**, subtly encouraging the user to accept.
- Smooth **scale & fade entrance animations** enhance the experience.
- **Falling snow and animated hearts** create a romantic atmosphere.
- Works seamlessly on **desktop and mobile** (mouse + touch supported).
